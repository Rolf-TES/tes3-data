The purpose is to list all IDs and their data from Morrowind, Tribunal and Bloodmoon. So that others do not have to search and write a lot.

Actually contains two columns, one for base Morrowind ID and other for those who need OpenMW/TES3MP IDs.

-- ingredients: List of all ingredient IDs, according to Construction Set, from Morrowind, Tribunal and Bloodmoon.

-- creatures: List of all creature IDs, according to Construction Set, from Morrowind, Tribunal and Bloodmoon. Does not include creatures already dead or from official plugins, such as 'Siege at Firemoth'.
