List of all creature IDs, according to Construction Set, from Morrowind, Tribunal and Bloodmoon. So that others do not find it overwhelming to search for and write down many names.

Advertisings:

-- Actually contains two lists, one for base Morrowind and other for those who need OpenMW/TES3MP names.

-- This does not include creatures already dead or from official plugins, such as 'Siege at Firemoth'.
